#!!below is an example of EDITING AN ITEM IN A LIST!!
# names_of_people_i_know[0] = 'arthur'
# print(names_of_people_i_know)
# person_i_disliked = f"{names_of_people_i_know[0].title()}"

#!!Below is how you add an item to to end
# print(names_of_people_i_know)
# names_of_people_i_know.append('Garry')
# print(names_of_people_i_know)
#!! appand() method makes it easy to start with empty list and add to it like below:
# dildoes = []
# dildoes.append('Blue Bad Dragon')
# dildoes.append('Green Bad Dragon')
# dildoes.append('Red Bad Dragon')
# print(dildoes)
#!! Here's how to use insert() method to add a new element at any position!!
# print(names_of_people_i_know)
# names_of_people_i_know.insert(1, 'John')
# print(names_of_people_i_know)
#!! This is how you remove an element!!
